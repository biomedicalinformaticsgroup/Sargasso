# 1) Build STAR indices for each species' genome
# 2) Build STAR indices for sequences to discard for each species (e.g. ribosomal RNA)
# 3) Map reads in each sample to sequences to discard for each species; retain only those reads which don't map to these sequences in either species
# 4) Map remaining reads in each sample to each species' genome
# 5) For each sample, take reads mapping to each genome and filter to their correct species of origin

# At each stage log output
